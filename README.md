# Armacost HHRGB14 Sub-Ghz Codes

These are captured Flipper Zero Sub-Ghz remote codes for an Armacost HHRGB14 
remote for Armacost's Slimline LED Lighting systems, so you can emulate its remote
if you're missing it. 

I don't know why some entries have "Guard_time" set, but I'm leaving them as is. 
Tested, all buttons work :)
